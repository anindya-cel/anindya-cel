# DNA to mRNA to Protein Transcriber

This web application converts a given DNA sequence into mRNA and then translates the mRNA sequence into a protein sequence using the genetic code table.

## How to Use

1. Input your DNA sequence into the "Input DNA (3'-5') Sequence" textarea.
2. Click the "Transcribe" button to convert the DNA sequence into mRNA.
3. The mRNA sequence will be displayed in the "mRNA Sequence" textarea.
4. Click the "Translate" button to translate the mRNA sequence into a protein sequence.
5. The protein sequence will be displayed in the "Protein Sequence" textarea.

## Features

- Converts DNA to mRNA.
- Translates mRNA to protein using the genetic code table.
- Copy mRNA and protein sequences to the clipboard.

## Genetic Code Table

The genetic code table used for translation is as follows:

| Codon | Amino Acid |
|-------|------------|
| UUU, UUC | Phe |
| UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG | Leu |
| ... | ... |
